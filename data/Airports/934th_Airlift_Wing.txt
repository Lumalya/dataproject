The 934th Airlift Wing is an Air Reserve Component of the United States Air Force. It is assigned to Twenty-Second Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and is stationed at Minneapolis-St Paul Joint Air Reserve Station, Minnesota.


== Mission ==
The wing's mission is to fly C-130H3 cargo aircraft, both airdropping and airlanding cargo and people.  Aeromedical evacuation of patients within the theater of operations is another facet of the mission. The 934th Airlift Wing supports the Air Force mission on a daily basis, providing airlift both in the United States and around the world.

=== Need for reserve troop carrier groups ===
After May 1959, the reserve flying force consisted of 45 troop carrier squadrons assigned to 15 troop carrier wings. The squadrons were not all located with their parent wings, but were spread over thirty-five Air Force, Navy and civilian airfields under what was called the Detached Squadron Concept.  The concept offered several advantages.  Communities were more likely to accept the smaller squadrons than the large wings and the location of separate squadrons in smaller population centers would facilitate recruiting and manning. However, under this concept, all support organizations were located with the wing headquarters. Although this was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult.  This weakness was demonstrated in the partial mobilization of reserve units during the Berlin Crisis of 1961.  To resolve this, at the start of 1962, Continental Air Command, (ConAC) determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons.  This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed.


=== Activation of the 934th Troop Carrier Group ===
As a result, the 934th Troop Carrier Group was activated at Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport, Minnesota on 11 February 1963 as the headquarters for the 96th Troop Carrier Squadron, which had been stationed there since January 1953. Along with group headquarters, a Combat Support Squadron, Materiel Squadron and a Tactical Infirmary were organized to support the 96th.
If mobilized, the group was gained by Tactical Air Command (TAC), which was also responsible for its training.  Its mission was to organize, recruit and train Air Force reservists in the tactical airlift of airborne forces, their equipment and supplies and delivery of these forces and materials by airdrop, landing or cargo extraction systems.
The group was one of two Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar groups assigned to the 440th Troop Carrier Wing in 1963, along with the 933d Troop Carrier Group at Billy Mitchell Field, Wisconsin.
In 1970, the group was re-equipped with the Lockheed C-130 Hercules.  The group has provided worldwide airlift and airdrops of passengers and materiel since 1963.  It has also periodically deployed to Panama, and later Puerto Rico, to fly cargo and personnel throughout Central and South America since 1979.
Upgraded to a Wing in 1994, it has deployed personnel and aircraft to participate in allied operations in the Persian Gulf area and the Balkans in 1990 and later.  It has also participated in numerous joint airborne training exercises and humanitarian airlifts.
