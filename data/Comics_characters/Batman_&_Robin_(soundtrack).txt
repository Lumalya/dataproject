== Background ==
Despite the overwhelming negative publicity the film received, its soundtrack became very popular and was well received, being certified platinum by the RIAA. The soundtrack included songs by R. Kelly, Arkarna, Jewel, Goo Goo Dolls, R.E.M., Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, and The Smashing Pumpkins, whose song "The End Is the Beginning Is the End" won the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance, which was played during the movie's closing credits. Three songs from the soundtrack became top-ten hits in the United States; Jewel's contribution, a radio-mix version of "Foolish Games" (US number two), as well as Bone Thugs-n-Harmony's "Look into My Eyes" (US number four) and R. Kelly's "Gotham City" (US number nine). Moloko's "Fun for Me" reached number four on the US Dance Play Chart and led for Roisin Murphy and Mark Brydon to kick off their US invasion.
